# Happy Plants: A data-driven predictive watering notification system

![](img/robots.png)

This project is currently under development

## Project aim

The goal of this project is to build a system that will notify me when it's a good time to manually water my plants.

In order to this, we will:

* use APIs and web scraping tools to gather historical and forecast rainfall data for my local area (Sydney)

* save the data into an sqlite database

* train a reinforcement learning model to predict when is the best time to manually water the plants

* use automation tools to ensure the data is gathered automatically on a daily basis and the model constantly improved as more data is obtained

We may also

* bootstrap the process with some synthetic data (noting that there isn't a history of forecasts, only of actual rainfall)

* host the system on AWS or GCP

* use terraform to create a reproducable infrastructure model that others can use to deploy the system
